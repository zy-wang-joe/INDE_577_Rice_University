## Dataset
- Wine Dataset
Wine dataset have three classes of target labels, and 13 features, which is a good dataset for testing a new classifier.
- Boston Housing Dataset
The Boston Housing Dataset is a derived from information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston MA. It has 1 continuous target, and 13 features, a good dataset for testing a new regression model.
