## Dataset used in applications
* *Fashion MNIST* data set

This is a dataset of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, along with a test set of 10,000 images. This dataset can be used as a drop-in replacement for MNIST.

The classes are: 

| Label      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |

| 1   | Trouser       |
| 2   | Pullover       |
| 3   | Dress     |
| 4   | Coat       |
| 5   | Sandal       |
| 6   | Shirt       |
| 7   | Sneaker       |
| 8   | Bag       |
