## Introduction
**Unsupervised learning**, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. Its ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it the ideal solution for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image recognition.

## How Unsupervised Learning Works
Simply put, unsupervised learning works by analyzing uncategorized, unlabeled data and finding hidden structures in it. In supervised learning, a data scientist feeds the system with labeled data, for example, the images of cats labeled as cats, allowing it to learn by example. In unsupervised learning, a data scientist provides just the photos, and it's the system's responsibility to analyze the data and conclude whether they're the images of cats.

## Algorithm
- PCA is the algorithm applied on high dimensional data, which reduce the dimensionality. The kept dimensions contain the most variance (information) of features.
- K-Means Clustering is the algorithm that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.
