## Introduction
Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. Its ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it the ideal solution for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image recognition.

## Algorithm
- PCA is the algorithm applied on high dimensional data, which reduce the dimensionality. The kept dimensions contain the most variance (information) of features.
- K-Means Clustering is the algorithm that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.
